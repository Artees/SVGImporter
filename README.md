# Automatic SVG to PNG Converter for Unity
This script automatically convert your SVG files to PNG whenever you place/update them inside your Assets folder. There are similar solutions on the Asset Store, but they are paid, so I decided to make one myself.

# Installation
1. Download and install Inkscape from its [official website](https://inkscape.org). The 0.92 version of Inkscape for 64-bit Windows sometimes freezes. Please use the 32-bit version.
2. Copy this Git repository into your project's Assets/SvgToPngConverter folder. Or use [Projeny](https://github.com/modesttree/Projeny) for package management (I recommend it).
3. If you run into an error, check that Inkscape has been added to your windows PATH variable.
